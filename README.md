# Demoguard Project

Two Chainguard-powered demos that show how to ship containerized apps with zero (or near-zero) CVEs.

- **demoguard** – Demonstrates Chainguard's ability to take an existing, vulnerable container image (with multiple CVEs) and automatically rebuild it as a clean, production-ready image with **zero CVEs** — no Dockerfile changes required.
- **tcguard** – My take on the *Chainguard Solutions Engineer Technical Challenge*.

Each application includes its own detailed `README.md` with instructions for building, running, and understanding the security benefits.
